# What to expect with this ReadME file:
In this file I will go through how to Compile your code (turn it into an EXE file instead of a .py file) I will teach you how to set up your Webhook to recive the token, I will teach you how to log in with your stolen token, and I will teach you how to customize certain things, mainly the message to display after the token has been sent to you.
 
 
 
 
 Well, It looks like somehow I deleted the GUI script but don't worry i'll have it done again in a week.
 I don't know how I deleted it, but here we are.
 
 # Logger without GUI:
 scroll through until about...

...here and replace whats in the "quotes" with your webhook URL.
How send the victim your python file if you are not turning it into an EXE.

# How to turn your script into and exe:
Run whatever python console you are using.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146260505-b34d6f8e-e937-48c4-bbef-fc91847a79f1.png)

Type in
pip install Pyinstaller
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146260623-19de23f5-1f49-4a6f-82b0-24a32c44674a.png)

this assuming you have pip installed.
hit enter
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146260691-63911a87-6c8f-4a02-a0bf-401fd20c7660.png)

you should get a lot of text. The only thing you should be concerned about is anything that seems to say error. With that i cannot help you here.
Next, change directories into your place where the script is stored. Im keeping mine on the desktop.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146260875-6448ecda-c120-4b9d-952f-0b596eb52d82.png)

next run the command:
Pyinstaller --onefile main.py
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146260990-561a0383-d503-4a30-befe-2ef9092568c3.png)

if you do not want the black screen to pop up as the token is being logged on the victims PC add the following "--noconsole" after "--onefile" like so:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146261129-8c2a1833-c4ba-41f3-b7d0-91329ff8a1bc.png)

hit enter.
If no errors occur (my code ain't perfect) you should get 3 or 4 folders/files.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146262353-f66e47c4-acda-433d-b17e-bb471eff52c0.png)

Go into dist
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146262407-70c6cd15-6515-4144-98f7-8218789f0392.png)

Here, you will find the compiled code, that you can rename, change the icon if you know how, and send to your victim.

Each time after the program is closed, a note file will open up stating the following error:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146262642-f718cec4-c11a-44ee-a104-33f6b0634f1d.png)

This is to make sure everything worked right. IF it appears, you should recive the token.
How do you know if it appears? Ask them about it i guess.
It should appear in the same file as the main.exe or whatever you named it.

# Thanks and Reasoning:
I would first off like to thank FekSake cause he has always been there to answer my stupid questions like "if i add --noconsole to the compiler does it remove the console?"
So thanks man.
I would also like to say I really could not have accomplished this first project without the help of OneMonth (not sponsored).
I made this little project because I felt like people should have a token logger that they can customize to their liking i guess. Honeslty i never would have though I would be able to do any of this but i guess here i am.

Open Script.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146274095-0e44e995-8f09-4a29-80d9-94802962ccd8.png)

Put token where it states "token here" (do in beetween quotes)

(thats an actual stolen token...)

Do CRTL and A at the same time to select all of the script.

Do CRTL and C at the saeme time to copy the entire script.
(no image)

Go back to your Discord page and do CTRL and V at the same time to paste your code into the console.

You should get a tiny:

then a wack of errors, HOLD UP!s and other stuff that you don't need to understand to do this ( in french cause the stolen account is french)

Hit the X in the top right corner (normal top right corner...)

And you should be logged into the account!

# How to change the message after the token has been sent you you:
So as you may know if you have read the complete readme file, a notepad message gets displayed after the token has been sent to you. Before changes, It looks like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146276548-a8054473-d980-408d-a31e-bd2a2f557123.png)

Follow these steps **very carefully** as to avoid accidentally ruining the code. Also please note that I do not think it is a great idea to mess with the code of the GUI grabber because it is so delicate that 1 misplaced " can leave you stumped for hours due to it being a mix of python and Tnk.

**Open your code in a code editor, such as sublime text.**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146276916-67a9f6e0-f218-4c30-816c-7388d57aade2.png)

To change the `name` of the file, you will have to modify a few things.
First thing is on line 3, and it would be the:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146277059-5a9710f7-2547-493f-b159-3ef9d5927a5a.png)

Change whats in the quotes to the name you like, but I do not recommend changing the file extension (.txt)

So now it should still look like before, but with that custom name of yours.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146277185-a161de18-722b-425b-8514-30afa4e567db.png)

The second thing we want to change is the file open command because it is not going to open a file if it doesn't exist.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146277273-ad153a79-be2b-4c65-b27b-6db1be3badd5.png)

As you can probably guess, we are going to ensure that the file name is the same as the other one.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146277384-9548eed5-2032-4039-9cf9-861cc99dbd20.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146277412-dd9dd289-09fc-4e33-b4b5-1d45d497c74d.png)

The third thing we have to change is the second open and write code (the one that actually writes). Do the same as before and ensure they match up all the same.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146277578-8af4b04c-246d-4630-8991-34b5e235cdd7.png)

The fourth thing we are going to change is the code that actually starts the file for the victim after their token has been logged.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146277697-b93f24de-fd0d-45ef-895a-95c2775098fe.png)

Now that thats done, make sure your code is saved, and try opening your script!
**WARNING:** MAKE SURE YOUR WEBHOOK IS SET TO A SECURE ENVIROMENT WITH JUST YOU OR SOMEONE YOU DON'T WANT LOGGING INTO YOUR ACCOUNT COULD LOG IN!
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146277979-2e7064d6-a5ef-420b-b130-be37542dfb31.png)

(empty folder with just my script)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60897810/146278038-de0a6cf4-a05c-4570-8817-18bc3af941c8.png)

The ChangedName.txt popped up meaning we're good to go!

And look! The token with any other information the code could collect was sent right from my *trusted* webhook! (stolen account from earlier)

# Please note! 9/10 Virus scanners will pick this up as a virus so there are downsides to using the exe and the .py.
