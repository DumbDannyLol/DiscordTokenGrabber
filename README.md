 Well, It looks like somehow I deleted the GUI script but don't worry i'll have it done again in a week.
 I don't know how I deleted it, but here we are.
 
 # Logger without GUI:
 scroll through until about...

...here and replace whats in the "quotes" with your webhook URL.
How send the victim your python file if you are not turning it into an EXE.

# How to turn your script into and exe:
Run whatever python console you are using.

Type in
pip install Pyinstaller

this assuming you have pip installed.
hit enter

you should get a lot of text. The only thing you should be concerned about is anything that seems to say error. With that i cannot help you here.
Next, change directories into your place where the script is stored. Im keeping mine on the desktop.

next run the command:
Pyinstaller --onefile main.py

if you do not want the black screen to pop up as the token is being logged on the victims PC add the following "--noconsole" after "--onefile" like so:

hit enter.
If no errors occur (my code ain't perfect) you should get 3 or 4 folders/files.

Go into dist

Here, you will find the compiled code, that you can rename, change the icon if you know how, and send to your victim.

Each time after the program is closed, a note file will open up stating the following error:

This is to make sure everything worked right. IF it appears, you should recive the token.
How do you know if it appears? Ask them about it i guess.
It should appear in the same file as the main.exe or whatever you named it.

# Thanks and Reasoning:
I would first off like to thank FekSake cause he has always been there to answer my stupid questions like "if i add --noconsole to the compiler does it remove the console?"
So thanks man.
I would also like to say I really could not have accomplished this first project without the help of OneMonth (not sponsored).
I made this little project because I felt like people should have a token logger that they can customize to their liking i guess. Honeslty i never would have though I would be able to do any of this but i guess here i am.

# This "Discord Token Grabber" should not be used for any malicous purposes! (how ironic)




# Please note! 9/10 Virus scanners will pick this up as a virus so there are downsides to using the exe and the .py.

# ENJOY! >:)
